      <h3>Things I can do.....</h3>
      <p>I have experience working in the telecom sector working as a technical equipment engineer where i specialised in the Installation of RF (Radio frequency) antennas, BTS and cabinet upgrade.I have sound and proven knowledge on static and dynamic website development for any type of businesses, schools and various organizations, using the HTML and CSS. Also, I am proficient in writing. I see writing as fun and I can breed life to papers through a pen. I have over 5 years of experience in project writing, essays, poem, letter, creative writing, and technical writing.
      Currently, I have started taking classes on backend development from Stutern, a software and product management school which I can recommend to anyone interested in learning a skill in tech. In few months time, I look forward to adding backend development to my vast knowledge of expertise.
